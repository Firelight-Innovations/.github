> **Bridging the gap between legacy enterprise systems and modern agentic AI.**

## 🚀 What We Are Working On

We are building **Weave**, an enterprise-grade AI agent orchestration platform designed to help mid-market companies deploy AI that actually works.

*   **Plugin-Driven Architecture:** A modular system where agents, data connectors, and tools run as isolated plugins.
*   **Legacy Integration:** Connects fragmented systems (ERPs, CRMs, SQL databases) to modern AI workflows without a "rip-and-replace" approach.
*   **Secure Deployment:** Built to run anywhere—cloud, on-premises, or fully air-gapped environments.

## 🎯 Our Goals

Our mission is to solve the "AI Integration Crisis" where 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail. We aim to:

*   **Orchestrate, Don't Just Automate:** Move beyond isolated chatbots to multi-agent systems that execute complex business processes.
*   **Democratize Enterprise AI:** Provide the "Operating System" that allows mid-market companies to compete with tech giants.
*   **Ensure Data Sovereignty:** Enable companies to use powerful AI while keeping their sensitive data secure and within their control.
